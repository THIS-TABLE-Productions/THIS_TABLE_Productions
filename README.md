We're indie game devs.
Get over it.

### THIS REPO...
is a combonation of all of our open source games.


### THESE PLANS
We will be attending OGPC ([Oregon Game Project Challenge](https://www.ogpc.info/)) Season 16, [Breaking Conventions](https://www.ogpc.info/seasons/2023.html), with our game, inspired by Rocket League, Disc Golf: Overdrive. In the game, you will control a car with the ability to jump and boost through the air to bonk a flying disc into the goal without touching the ground.
